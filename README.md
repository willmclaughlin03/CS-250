How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is a key part of creating the best possible software, and this can be done in multiple ways. The best way in my opinion is gathering feedback from a group of users, and then organizing the stories in your scrum team. This allows you to narrow down what is important to the users, and organize how you tackle problems and add features.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching development needs to be a methodical, team based approach to achieve the best results. Creating preliminary graphs and charts for your team to organize changes needed, and communicate more efficently is a great agile way to approach developing programs. The scrum meetings and events are extremely helpful as well, as when tackling problems you will need help, and the gathering of feedback and ideas is fantastic for doing this.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means playing the role given to you to the best of your ability, and communicating and participating well. Everyone on the scrum team needs to contribute to create the best possible software. Being a good team member means giving advice or assistance as well, and it also means never trying to do it all by yourself. Following agile practices and communication methods are the best ways to find success in a team.
